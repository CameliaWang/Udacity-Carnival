# Udacity-Carnival
This is a starter project from the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree Program. This project includes three games which are a coin toss game, a wheel of fortune game and a Plinko game. I used Unity 2017.2.0 and GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0.

In this project, I wrote C# to create interactions with pre-built assets.
